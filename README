This is the code for the Appsonroids Minecraft Website.

The backend is (being) written in JSP.
The frontend will be done in jQuery, with some HTML (go figure) and CSS (no, really).

There are design plans, located in the design folder.

We gladly accept screenshots, which should (hopefully) be from our server, and would be grateful if you could commit them straight into the res/screenshots folder.

I've started a basic blog, which we will use for the announcements box on the website (see: Design) at http://aorminecraft.posterous.com/

Launching the email.jar:
