This will be the Appsonroids Minecraft Website.
There are design plans which will soon ( < 1 week) be up.
The backend is currently planned to be written in Java, but may change.
The frontend will be done in jQuery, with some HTML (go figure) and CSS (no, really).
I'll work on this more once I have time, and am not on vacation :)
