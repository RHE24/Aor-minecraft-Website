<p>
<i>	-- The Book of Aor, Chapter 1 </i>
<p>
Are you ready for creeper-killing, brick-breaking, cactus-cultivating PANDEMONIUM? Get ready for MINECRAFT like you&rsquo;ve NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE! The great Aor, better known as the Greek god of infinite maps, has moved to MINECRAFT to create a world far too EPIC to actually exist! Join our band of warriors, farmers and urban architects in building factories, towers, bridges, castles and MORE while holding back the nightly onslaught of VICIOUS and often SUICIDALLY EXPLOSIVE MONSTERS! Will our heroes survive the darkness that lurks at every turn? Or will our monuments fade into ruin? Only time will tell in a world where ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE!
<p>
Prepare yourself. It will not be easy. But succeed and you will reap rewards greater than your wildest dreams.
