The Brains Behind Aor - Three Mods You Should Know


-- HOST OF MACHINES --
----- HYPERSONIC -----
Rendered as Hypersonic96 in the Leningrad edition of The Book of Aor
Referred to in some rabbinical texts as "Josh" or "[Server]

The owner of www.AppsOnRoids.com and all of its subdomains, Hypersonic hosts the Minecraft server itself and is the closest connection to Aor. He alone has access to the Codex of Chunks and the House of Playerfiles, and can use his powers to accomplish effortlessly what others would find impossible. The most experienced programmer of the Three Advisors, he takes care of most of the complicated code on the website, leading the Library of jQuery and the Laboratory of JSP.

--- LORD OF HTML ---
------ HGILMAN -----
Identified in the Baraita as iDunce
Maimonides mentions a similar character known as "Herbie", but it is unclear as to whether these two are the same.

The writer of most of the website, hgilman advises and aids Hypersonic in his duties as Host of Machines. Over the years, hgilman has developed a profound bond with Aor and is skilled in sending players to the Pit of Banishment or drawing items from the Endless Chest of /Give, although Hypersonic has commanded him to use these techniques sparingly lest he be executed in the Electric Chair of /Deop. Unlike the other Advisors, hgilman posseses the Clay of Dreamweaver, out of which beautiful websites can be formed.



--- PATRON OF ART ----
---- X_SHANGHAI_X ----
In The Saga of the Creeper, an ancient text predating the Book of Aor, a character displaying similar attributes and duties as x_Shanghai_x is mentioned under the name of "Brendan".
Medieval texts refer to him as "Shanghai", although this is frowned upon as a sign of unintelligence.

When Hypersonic deemed that the world of Aor was to be closed to new occupants, the artist x_Shanghai_x convinced him that more players would not harm the purity of the land. Because of this, x_Shanghai_x is largely responsible for the current state of the world. He inspired some of the most fantastic structures ever created, including the Divine Farm of Infinite Cacti that was lost in the map switch during the transition into the Third Age.
