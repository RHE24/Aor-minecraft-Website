The Brains Behind Aor


-- HOST OF MACHINES --
----- HYPERSONIC -----
Rendered as Hypersonic96 in the Leningrad edition of The Book of Aor
Referred to in some rabbinical texts as "Josh" or "[Server]

The owner of www.AppsOnRoids.com and all of its subdomains, Hypersonic hosts the Minecraft server itself and is the closest connection to Aor. He alone has access to the Codex of Chunks and the House of Playerfiles, and can use his powers to accomplish effortlessly what others would find impossible. The most experienced programmer of the Three Advisors, he takes care of most of the complicated code on the website, leading the Library of jQuery and the Laboratory of JSP.

--- LORD OF HTML ---
------ HGILMAN -----
Identified in the Baraita as iDunce
Maimonides mentions a similar character known as "Herbie", but it is unclear as to whether these two are the same.

The writer of most of the website, hgilman advises and aids Hypersonic in his duties as Host of Machines. Over the years, hgilman has developed a profound bond with Aor and is skilled in sending players to the Pit of Banishment or drawing items from the Endless Chest of /Give, although Hypersonic has commanded him to use these techniques sparingly lest he be executed in the Electric Chair of /Deop. Unlike the other Advisors, hgilman posseses the Clay of Dreamweaver, out of which beautiful websites can be formed.



-- PATRON OF ART --
---- x_Shanghai_x ----
Referred to as Brendan in many texts
Sometimes know as Shanghai-, but this is extraordinarily rare, and only minimally mentioned where seen.

One of the mods. He does art on occasion, which is sometimes commisioned by the great [Server]. He is also partially responsible for convincing Hypersonic that more players would be acceptable, and is thus largely responsible for the world as it is today. Though occasionally on haitus, he inspires some of the most fantastical structures to be built, such as the stunning Cactus farm in the days of yore.
